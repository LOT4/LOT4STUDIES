00. Separate to the LOT4_scripts, DAPs will first run the pregnancy algorithm, which will create a dataset of pregnancies that we will use in step 3.

0. 99_path.R <- setting path. If a folder has already been created by this script, it will not recreate the folder if run a second time. 

1. to_run_preselect <- creates the preselection data subsets

2. to_run_source_pop_counts.R <- intermediate analysis that gives overall monthly counts of events per 1000 people per month for all concept sets
Latest update v1.3 includes:
- splits data processing by region and subpopulation if required (BIFAP)
- create study population
- creates sterility file
- create entry/exit dates
- creates denominator (persons who are in the study each month)
- creates concept set data sets for EVENTS, MEDICINES, PROCEDURES
- does the counts and csv/excel files
- creates plots

3. to_run_final_counts.R <- This is an upgraded copy of to_run_source_pop_counts.R
This will include in addition:
- read in the study population and concept set data sets that were created by to_run_souce_pop_counts.R
- create baseline table, total number of people, total number of retinoid users, total number of valproate users, between entry/exit.
- read in created pregnancy data set
- counts of new study variables: pregnancy test, pregnancy, contraception coverage
- creation of stratification variables: indication, reason for discontinuation: ADR, pregnancy
- creation of treatment episodes & pregnancy episodes
- run new counts (using the existing counts scripts, maybe a modification?)

4. Pooling for BIFAP
5. ITS analysis
6. Any final plots/visualisations and pooling
